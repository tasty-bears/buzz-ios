iOS application for Angora project.

Implemented this far:
  basic views and models are layed out
  controllers are created and hooked up to views
  when app runs only the segues for profile and see my courses work - the course lists and event lists aren't populated yet


Needs implemented/in the works:
  write segue functions to pass the appropriate objects between views
  writing the json reader to create the objects for the views
  authentication for app needs to be written yet

Current functionality:
  only views accesible are the home view, profile page, and schedule list
  profile page and schedule list don't currently populate with needed data, in the works
